#Navbar: In the navbar i have placed Website Name, Home, Blog and user authentication role base route;

#Home-Page: At the top i have showed a hard-coded data then i have placed three dynamic data from backend which i placed in mongodb server. Then i have showed another hard coded section and footer 

#Categories: By clicking on the dynamic data on the home page, I have shown many more products related to that data;

#Bookings: I have input the category router data from the model and put it in the backend and from there through the backend server it shows the My Orders rowdy under the dashboard.

#Payment: Added payment route by implementing a payment gateway through react stripe showing data in my orders router
